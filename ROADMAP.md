# picos Roadmap

## v0.2.0 - OS Inventory and Network Tools

Status: complete on `codex/picos-v0.1-scaffold`.

- Full-screen terminal OS shell.
- System, hardware, storage, process, network, action, status, and log panels.
- `picos info --full`.
- Safe `ping` options.
- Safe TCP connect check via `picos connect <host> <port>`.
- Read-only action model with write/destructive actions locked.
- Agent docs and verification harness.

## v0.2.1 - Console Polish

Goal: make the current TUI feel denser, cleaner, and more OS-like.

- Improve panel spacing and truncation.
- Add richer status badges for permission, network, and command state.
- Add clearer Network Tools action previews.
- Improve small-terminal sidebar window behavior.
- Keep all write/destructive actions locked.

## v0.2.2 - lazyifconfig Tools and Routes Parity

Status: in progress.

Goal: implement the lazyifconfig feature set in picos, starting with read-only Tools Hub and Route Inspector.

- `picos tools dns <target>`.
- `picos tools whois <target>`.
- `picos tools ip-info <ip>`.
- `picos tools port-check <host> <port>`.
- `picos tools tls <host:port>`.
- `picos tools ping <host>`.
- `picos tools traceroute <host>`.
- `picos routes` with parsed route summary and diagnostics.
- `picos route <destination>` destination path lookup.
- `picos connections` active endpoint parser and raw output.
- `picos ports` listening port parser and raw output.
- TUI Connections and Ports panels backed by live OS data.
- Next: route detail TUI, raw output viewer workspace, and richer process attribution.

## v0.3.0 - DOS/File Manager, Editor, and Dialogs

Status: in progress.

Goal: add the first local filesystem console that is useful in daily work.

- Files workspace.
- Safe read-only commands: `pwd`, `dir`, `ls`, `type`, `cat`.
- System-wide file entry points: root, home, workspace, temp, and Windows system drive.
- Absolute path and `~` support in file commands.
- Planned safe navigation command: `cd` inside the TUI file workspace.
- Text/Markdown viewer.
- TUI editor buffer with dirty state.
- Confirm, input, error, progress, and command palette dialogs.
- Save behind explicit confirmation.
- Delete/move/copy remain locked until preview and confirmation are implemented.

## v0.3.1 - Keyboard File Navigation

Status: draft PR #2.

Goal: make the Files workspace usable as a keyboard-driven local file manager.

- Files child focus entered with `enter`.
- `j/k` entry selection inside Files.
- `enter` opens directories or previews files.
- `u` moves to the parent directory.
- `h`/`esc` returns to workspace navigation.
- Permission and missing-file failures are reported in the event log.
- Next: path input dialog, copy/move/delete previews, and editor dirty-state controls.

## v0.3.2 - File Location Jumps

Status: draft PR #3.

Goal: make the Files workspace feel more like an OS file panel with quick system entry points.

- `g` cycles through root, home, workspace, temp, and drive locations.
- The active quick location is highlighted in the Files panel.
- Location jumps reuse the same safe local provider boundary as normal file listing.
- Failed jumps are reported in the event log.
- Next: direct path input dialog and location selection by number.

## v0.3.3 - Path Command Line

Status: in progress on `codex/picos-v0.3.3-path-command-line`.

Goal: add the first DOS-like command prompt inside the Files workspace.

- `:` opens a path input line while Files focus is active.
- Typed paths support the same local provider rules as CLI file commands, including absolute paths and `~`.
- `enter` submits and lists the target directory.
- `esc` cancels the prompt.
- `backspace` edits the buffer.
- Failed path jumps are reported in the event log.
- Next: location selection by number and command palette dialog.

## v0.3.4 - SFTP-like Remote Files

Goal: add remote file browsing through the same provider model as local files.

- `FileProvider` abstraction with `local` and `sftp` kinds.
- SFTP profiles with host, port, username, key path, and root.
- Remote list/read first.
- Remote write behind visible host/path confirmation.
- No password persistence.

## v0.4.0 - Privileged Controls Framework

Goal: prepare real OS mutation without making it casual or dangerous.

- Preview/dry-run framework.
- Confirmation phrase flow.
- Admin/elevation detection by platform.
- Audit log for write/destructive attempts.
- First controlled mutation prototype.

## v0.5.0 - Developer Environment Plugins

Goal: expand beyond local OS inventory into developer operations.

- Plugin registry design.
- Docker read-only plugin.
- SSH profile inventory.
- Logs workspace.
- System monitor workspace.
