# picos Roadmap

## v0.2.0 - OS Inventory and Network Tools

Status: complete on `codex/picos-v0.1-scaffold`.

- Full-screen terminal OS shell.
- System, hardware, storage, process, network, action, status, and log panels.
- `picos info --full`.
- Safe `ping` options.
- Safe TCP connect check via `picos connect <host> <port>`.
- Read-only action model with write/destructive actions locked.
- Agent docs and verification harness.

## v0.2.1 - Console Polish

Goal: make the current TUI feel denser, cleaner, and more OS-like.

- Improve panel spacing and truncation.
- Add richer status badges for permission, network, and command state.
- Add clearer Network Tools action previews.
- Improve small-terminal sidebar window behavior.
- Keep all write/destructive actions locked.

## v0.3.0 - DOS/File Manager, Editor, and Dialogs

Goal: add the first local filesystem console that is useful in daily work.

- Files workspace.
- Safe read-only commands: `pwd`, `dir`, `ls`, `cd`, `type`, `cat`.
- Text/Markdown viewer.
- TUI editor buffer with dirty state.
- Confirm, input, error, progress, and command palette dialogs.
- Save behind explicit confirmation.
- Delete/move/copy remain locked until preview and confirmation are implemented.

## v0.3.1 - SFTP-like Remote Files

Goal: add remote file browsing through the same provider model as local files.

- `FileProvider` abstraction with `local` and `sftp` kinds.
- SFTP profiles with host, port, username, key path, and root.
- Remote list/read first.
- Remote write behind visible host/path confirmation.
- No password persistence.

## v0.4.0 - Privileged Controls Framework

Goal: prepare real OS mutation without making it casual or dangerous.

- Audit log for write/destructive attempts.
- First controlled mutation prototype.

## v0.5.0 - Developer Environment Plugins
